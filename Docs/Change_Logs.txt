Version 2.10:
- New Quests system : Each quest is meant to tell a story and, in essence, consists of a collection of scenes linked with each other in a number different paths + a number of actions you can take with specific buildings depending on the current 'stage' of the quest to advance the story. Unlike normal scenes which trigger under certain conditions + RNG while the player is doing seemingly unrelated stuffs, quests are designed to involve the player more proactively - the story only starts and progresses if the player takes the needed action (with quest objective UI elements to make the next step(s) clear). Just like scenes though, quests are fully moddable simply using a text editor - early-adopting modders can start adding their own new quests right away after v2.10 is out.
- First two quests: sabotage & missing person case. I chose to make these two first because they are structurally contrasting to each other:
- The sabotage quest: this is an example of a 'radiant quest' that can repeated unlimited times with different NPCs each time. This quest involves the player trying to break up the relationship of a couple, with multiple options how to go about this and multiple endings. A lot of variables and very non-linear.
- The missing person investigation quest: this is an example of a 'story quest' that can only be done once per playthrough. All the characters involved in the story are fixed in name, appearance (I 'designed' their faces and bodies myself) and attributes. It's a lot more linear than the radiant quest above and less variable, thus allowing for a longer story with more character development.
- Bug fixes and other improvements, with a public beta testing period

Version 2.9:
1/ New Karma system:
- many actions and decisions you take will now increase (help a colleague, stop domestic violence, etc) or decrease (cheating, murder, etc) Karma
- The higher your current Karma, the harder it is to continue increasing it (diminishing returns from the same act of kindness) but the easier it is for Karma to drop, and vice versa. This prevents you from maximizing Karma easily, but also prevents Karma from staying at rock bottom.
- Karma works by affecting most RNG (random number generator) calculations in scenes. High Karma skews the RNG in your favour, and vice versa. For example: if your chance of getting laid depends on "If Random(0, 100) < HotChick:attractiontoplayer" , max Karma would turn it into Random(0, 50) and minimum Karma would turn it into Random(0, 150). There's a perk to remove negative impact of Karma.
- The cheat options to 'undo' your Death, Imprisonment or STD will now, more immersively, consume a huge amount of Karma instead (as in: you already cheated Death, so it's only fair that you suffer a string of bad luck afterwards).
2/ New Achievements system: first 36 Achievements
- Tracks optional 'objectives' for the player to aim for, depending on play style and how you roleplay. Examples include having anal sex with n number of partners, become a millionaire, or keep mood above 90 for 30 consecutive days
- Rewards the player with permanent stat boosts which would have been very difficult to achieve in normal gameplay, plus perks points that can be used to unlock new perks
3/ New Perks system: first 13 perk trees
- These are powerful benefits to gameplay that can be unlocked by spending perk points earned from Achievements.
- Some are perk trees with multiple levels, some are unique single perks
- Examples include: minimum attraction level for all new NPCs you meet, earn monthly % interest on your wealth, your date responds well to all activities you take her out on (instead of moaning about half of them)
- Also includes a perk tree that softens (then eliminates at lvl 5) the impact of negative Karma - a good investment for those who want to play an evil character but don't want all the bad luck
4/ New menu that shows the available actions at the player's current location, meant to save you some repetitive clicking and scrolling. Also, double-clicking on a building will now make the player character go there.
5/ Fix some mistakes and inconsistencies in scene conditions. Special thanks to Lostlegends (who have also published a few mods for the game btw) for compiling the list for these.
6/ Other bug fixes and minor improvements, with a public beta testing period

Version 2.8:
- Shadows, ambient occlusion and depth of field for the 3d bedroom sex scenes, plus Esc > Settings option to set DOF strength (set it to 0 to disable DOF entirely)

- Bug fixes and other improvements, with a public beta testing period

Version 2.6:
This update covers the rest of the adult animation types not yet covered in v2.1, v2.2 and v2.3. After this update, with virtually all sex scenes you can trigger in game, you will be able to enjoy new, better-looking animations made specifically for the new Daz character models:
34 new animations, made specifically for the new character models so that they look much better than the old converted ones, consisting of:
- 10 shemale on female animations
- 6 shemale on male animations (when you start a sex scene between a shemale and a man, the shemale will be bottom by default, you'll need to click anywhere > Swap roles to see these new animations)
- 4 reverse gangbang animations
- 10 gay animations
- 2 tittyfuck and 2 footjob animations (male-female)

Version 2.5:
- Add horses to the game, with customizable coat colors and patterns
- Some scenes about being a horse owner
- 14 'interspecies' animations and scenes to trigger them for those that play with the Bestiality module enabled
- Bug fixes and other improvements, with a public beta testing period

Version 2.4:
- Animated object system for sex animations: not only is this required for bondage content but it will also be crucial for when I implement stuffs like dildos and furniture in the future
- Introduce the first few pieces of bondage gear: chastity strap, torso rope, collar, handcuffs, shin cuffs, thigh cuffs, mask, blindfold, foulard, tape and ball gag. More complex stuffs like furniture and full-body pieces to be introduced in future versions
- Effects to go with the new bondage gear: no dirty talk or blowjob while gagged, no penetration with the strap, automatic sex animation adjustment to bound poses while wearing handcuffs & shin/thigh cuffs (the handcuff pose looks fine for most animatons, but the shin cuff pose is a bit hit and miss for now), 
- Bug fixes and other improvements, with a public beta testing period

Version 2.3:
- 31 new animations, made specifically for the new character models so that they look much better than the old converted ones, covering:
1/ 11 new aggressive male-female animations
2/ 8 new aggressive female-male animations (i.e. Femdom)
3/ 5 new gangbang (1 woman, 3 or 4 men) animations
4/ 7 new solo / masturbation animations
(Obviously even after this third animation update, not all types of sex scenes will have been covered yet. Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about reverse gangbang, gay, shemale and 'interspecies' animations - they will be covered in future updates, probably around v2.7, v2.8, etc)
- Improve the optional first person POV cameras for sex scenes (accessed by right click anywhere > Switch camera), mostly importantly: eliminate the camera shakes
- New Esc > Settings option for "New Animations Only" for those that prefer quality to quantity in their sex scenes or just can't stand the old converted animations.
- More flexible animation filtering for shemales - they can now use the normal female animations (the new femdom animations work quite well with shemale-male scenes for example) in addition to the ones made specifically for shemales
- Some new API functions requested by modders
- Bug fixes and other improvements, with a public beta testing period

Version 2.2:
- 32 new sex animations made specifically for the new models, including:
++ 7 Lesbian animations
++ 9 Anal Male-Female animations
++ 6 Male-Male-Female threesome animations
++ 10 Male-Female-Female threesome animations
- Hide the in-scene character generation and dressing process away from the player's view (so that you no longer have to see NPCs naked and in T-pose for a second before the clothes appear and the idle animation starts whenever they show up in a scene)
- More fatal error crash preventions, tested by beta testers before release
- Bug fixes and other improvements

Version 2.1:
- 20 new sex animations made specifically for the new models, using the new rigs. I think these look much better than the ones included so far in the game, which were initially made for the old 'Legacy' models then converted.
- First implementation of physics in the game: boob jiggles during sex animations. They look pretty good with the new animations above IMHO (especially the new reverse cowgirl ones)
- Average bust and penis size settings in the "Customize NPC Distribution" menu
- Improve the 'Recommended Actions' feature and resolve its compatibility issues with some non-London maps
- Bug fixes and other improvements, with a public beta testing period

Version 2.0 Stable:
This update wraps up the graphical overhaul the game underwent over the last 5 updates + make some improvements in term of user-friendliness and finally bring 2.0 out of beta:
- New 'Recommended Actions' feature for those who prefer a bit of hand-holding, or simply can't be bothered to micro-manage your character's life (if you're super lazy, just keep pressing R after each action to go for the next recommendation) . Unfortunately it turns out this new feature causes freezes with some optional maps (will fix in 2.1), use the freeze fix above if you're playing outside the default Central London map.
- Hairstyles and facial & body hairstyles for the new male model
- Clothes for the new male model
- Each morph slider now also come with a box where you can enter a specific value outside of the usual 0.0 - 1.0 range to really fine-tune your character. Do so wth caution though as anything outside the normal range might deform the character.
- Some UI & control improvements, tooltips and other tweaks to make the game more user-friendly. People without a middle mouse button can now control the camera fine.
- Split the assets for the old 'Legacy' character models into an optional download, so that everyone doesn't have to download hundreds of mb for an optional setting that's disabled by default
- Bug fixes, performance optimizations and crash preventions
There are no 'Update Only' downloads for 2.0 Stable (they would have been way too huge to be useful anyway), only the full downloads, because the base requirement for future 'Update Only' downloads is now reset to 2.0 Stable (just like it did back in v1.10) so that the 'Update Only' download packages for 2.1, 2.2, etc will stay under 100 mb or so.

Version 2.0 Beta 4:
- Introduce the Daz models for male characters
- Convert / retareget all existing sex animations for the new male model
- Add scale X, Y and Z options under Morphs > Scale. This may work better than the FBMHeight morph to create short characters
- All male presets in vin_Base/Presets will now work with the new male model
- 'Customize NPC Distribution' settings will now work with the new male model 
- Bug fixes, including the rent calculation and everlasting pregnant belly bugs
- Performance optimizations and reducing some file's sizes (thanks to this, you may notice that Beta 4's download package is actually smaller than Beta 3 despite the addition of male models)
Basically, with this version, you can play the game normally, except all the guys will stay naked and have the same hairstyle with no facial hair (hair and clothes will be the focus of the next version)

Version 2.0 Beta 3:
This update completes the switch into Daz3d for the female models:
- More hairstyles for the new female models
- Clothes for the new female models
- Expand the presets in Content\Modules\vin_Base\Presets so that they work with the new female models too
- The Customize NPC Distribution percentages will now work with the new female models too
- Enable a number of length/ scale morphs in the character creation menu (for example, to make a short character etc)
- Bug fixes and other improvements

Version 2.0 Beta 2:
- Convert the rest of the adult animations for the new female models
- Shemale support for the new female models, with a more detailed and customizable penis than before
- 8 pubic hair styles (with the usual thickness and color customization options) for the new female models
- Pregnancy support for the new female models
- Cum effects for the new female models
- An option in Esc > Customize NPC Distribution to specify a percentage of new NPCs that still use the old 'Legacy' models (default: 0%)
- Unless you specifically set the setting above to higher than 0%, the old 'Legacy' female model will no longer be loaded by the game at startup, which improves performance
- Bug fixes and performance optimizations
Basically with this update, the game can be played normally now with the new female model and all the existing animations working with it, except they will still remain naked (clothes for the new female model coming in Beta 3)

Version 2.0 Beta 1:
First beta implementation of Daz3d female models into the game (full plans here). Basically the new models are now available for both the player character (select female gender, then Daz3d (Beta) race) and NPCs (all new female NPCs will use the new model, although those from your old save won't switch automatically, you will have to go into Contacts menu to Edit Appearance them manually). 
Even though it's only the first beta for 2.0, you can play the game pretty much normally with the new models except:
- All women using the new models will always be naked (who's complaining!) - clothes will be converted in Beta 3
- Just 3 hairstyles (but the hairstyles now have customizable morphs) for the new ladies for now - more will come in Beta 3
- Just 20 sex animations converted for now (the rest to be converted in the next version) covering only some MF, FF and Solo Female. Triggering more advanced sex scenes like threesome, gangbang etc won't give you any animations - you'll have to right click > skip scene in that case.
- No trans characters using Daz3d models yet (to be available next version), all shemales use the old model for now - so if you see a new female NPC using the old model, she has a dick!
New game is recommended for easy playtesting with the new models. Old saves are technically compatible but because I changed the default skin colors and adjust the lighting - the player and NPCs from your old save might look very red now - you will have to edit them and reselect a skin color (while you're at it, you might as well switch all the female NPCs from your old save to the new Daz3d race too)
